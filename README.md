## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently VP of Engineering at Possip, scaling our platform and team. My journey into tech started after a chapter on Wall Street!
- 🌱 I'm diving deep into AI tools (like Gemini, Claude, Cursor) and applying them to personal data analysis projects. Always guided by first-principles thinking.
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with any and all new tools and technologies
- 💬 Ask me about: Engineering Leadership, Quantified Self, Lifelogging, Personal Archiving, or applying AI to interesting datasets
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... you can read more about me on my personal site: [officeofadamthede.com](https://officeofadamthede.com)
